# Start-Page
Start page made after a linux terminal with functional commands for shortcuts and searches.

Commands supported:
Touch [name] [url] (create link in current dir)

echo [Sentence] 

mkdir [name]

rmdir [name]

rm [name]

ls

clear

cd

locate [query](duckduckgo search)

# Planned additions

I want to export folders and links into a config file so that changes can be made permanent. I figured this would be the most appropriate way of saving stuff since I don't really plan on hosting it anywhere.

Also i plan on giving some color options for links although I like having files/directories on a clearly distinct color.

## Planned commands
notes - quick way of adding notes/todos and removing them. Not sure how I plan on displaying it for now.
