# Start-Page
Start page made after a linux terminal with functional commands for shortcuts and searches.

Directories are supposed to serve as bookmark categories and 'files' as bookmarks/links.

for navigation commands both absolute and relative paths are supported, only paths like 
"cd ../dir/" are not supported atm.

Same goes for mkdir, rmdir, touch, and rm. 

You can open shortcuts and enter folders also by selecting them with the tab key and hitting enter or mouse clicking

the "ls" command can list contents of an absolute path or a relative path in the subdirectory of the current location

Commands supported:
Touch [name] [url] (create link in current dir)

echo [Sentence] 

mkdir [name]

rmdir [name]

rm [name]

ls

clear

cd | cd .. | cd [path]

locate [query](duckduckgo search)

Links and directories are saved to the local storage now, if there is no config found 
in local storage the page will just create an empty home directory

# Planned additions

I plan on giving some color options for links although I like having files/directories on a clearly distinct color.

In the future i will add the possibilities to type the name of a file/link that is stored as a command to open the link stored in that file

## Planned commands
notes - quick way of adding notes/todos and removing them. Not sure how I plan on displaying it for now.
